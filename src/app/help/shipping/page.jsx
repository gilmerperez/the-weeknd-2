              Some carriers will mark a package as delivered before they actually deliver it. Though unusual, this can
              happen up to 5 days before an item is actually delivered. You can try contacting the carrier to get better
              insight into the delay. If you still haven&apos;t received your package after 5 days, and you&apos;ve
              checked with your neighbors and still don&apos;t have it, please reach out to us here and we&apos;ll do

              Depending on your country, you may be charged customs/import fees. Customs charges and fees are the sole

              The time it takes for your order to be delivered depends on the shipping method chosen at checkout. Please

              For deliveries outside of the US: Please note that these orders need to pass through the customs office in

              Once an order leaves our warehouse, carrier shipping delays may occur due to factors outside our control.

              Contacting the carrier is the best way to get more insight into your package&apos;s location and estimated

              In most cases, excluding pre-orders, orders ship within 2-3 business days. Shipping and delivery dates

              Note that unless otherwise noted, or the option to ship items separately as they become available is
